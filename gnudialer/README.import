the data must be in quote-delimited format (csv is quote delimited
with first record containing field names).

********************************************************************

i've done a modification to up.cpp so that you can upload csv data 
where you had empty fields, like...

"4085551212",,"Richard Lyman","100 MAIN ST","SAN JOAQUIN","CA","93660",,,,,"06087"

as long as the last field isn't empty, it will now work. so...

"4085551212",,,,,,,,,,,"06087"		this is valid
"4085551212",,,,,,,,,,,			this is NOT valid
