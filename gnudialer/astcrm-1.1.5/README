IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------

	By default, astcrm uses "crm" for the manager
	username and "1234" for the secret.

	EXAMPLE: /etc/asterisk/manager.conf
 
		[general]
		enabled = yes
		port = 5038
		...

		[crm]
		secret = 1234
		read = call,agent,user
		write = call,agent,user

	this is a change, before it used dialer (ages ago)
	and mon.html was just changed to username 'crm' also.

	You can change them by editing crm.html and mon.html
	in the APPLET PARAM tags.  Comments are provided for
	help in locating the correct lines to edit.

0. LICENSE
----------

	astcrm is a general purpose CRM program for asterisk.
	It is provided with NO WARRANTY.  Please see LICENSE
	for details.

1. INSTALLATION
---------------

	Please see the INSTALL file for instructions.

2. USING ASTCRM
---------------

	astcrm provides a user interface to edit information
	in a mysql table by an agent.

	1. When an agent is logged in, it is running a 1x1
	   applet that is logged in to asterisk manger. It
	   watches to see if the agent got a call, then it
	   refreshes the frame and a cgi script allows the
	   agent to edit the record info.

	2. The user's screen will show your predefined script
	   allowing them to edit the record as they please.

	3. When another request is made to the user, the
	   previous record is automatically re-submitted
	   and updated in MySQL.

	Here's how to set up a script...

	*  Your scripts should be named thesqltable.script
	   and should be place in your "/cgi-bin/" directory.

	*  They should be written in HTML.

	*  Do not include the <FORM></FORM> tags; they will
	   already be provided.

	*  Do not provide a <INPUT TYPE=SUBMIT> button of any
	   kind.  The information is automatically updated in
	   MySQL when the next record comes in.

	*  To make a value from a field appear on the screen,
	   use the syntax " ${fieldname} ".

	*  When the info is submitted, astcrm will attempt to
	   update all form fields that have "-use" appended to
	   their field name.

	   For example, if you want the user to be able to see
	   AND edit the field "income", simply write...

	   <input type="text" name="income-use" value="${income}">

	*  See "example.script" if you are having trouble
	   grasping the concept.

	*  When an agent is finished taking calls, he/she should
	   always remember to click on the "Logout" link.  This
	   ensures that the last record is updated in the database
	   because it won't be otherwise since no other call will
	   come in to update the previous record.

3. AGENT LOGIN
--------------

	* Each agent should simply visit:

		http://yourdomainorip/crm/crmlogin.html

	* The agent should enter his/her "agent number"
	  from agents.conf.

4. AGENT MONITORING
-------------------

	A separate interface is provided for watching the same as
	an agent is seeing while he/she is taking calls.

	* To monitor, the staff member should visit:

		http://yourdomainorip/crm/monlogin.html

	* The staff member should enter the agent number of the
	  agent he/she wishes to monitor.

	* It is important to monitor using this interface instead
	  of the agent crm interface to ensure, that each record
	  is not updated 2x, thus allowing for possible information
	  loss.
