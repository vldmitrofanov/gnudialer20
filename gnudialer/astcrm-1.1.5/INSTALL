Dependencies:

	Apache
	MySQL (client and server)
	JDK (optional) - see note below

To install astcrm:

	1. ./configure <path to html document root> <path to cgi-bin directory>
	2. make
	3. make install

*** Note ***

	If you get a java error when compiling it is because you don't
	have JDK installed.  That's okay though, because the precompiled
	.class file is included.  If you get the error, feel free to go
	ahead and "make install" anyway.

The file astcrm.conf in "cgi-bin" should contain 5 lines.
It should look like this:

yourastcrmpassword (not currently used)
yourMySQLusername
yourMySQLpassword
yourMySQLhostname
yourMySQLdatabase

*** If using with GnuDialer, the dbname should be "dialer"
