	GnuDialer is a general purpose inbound/outbound dialer
	for Asterisk. It is provided with NO WARRANTY. Please

1. INSTALLATION
---------------

	Please see the INSTALL file for instructions.

2. RUNNING GNUDIALER
--------------------

	a. To start gnudialer, simply type "gnudialer" at a
	   console.  It is strongly recommended that you run
	   gnudialer as root.  It is possible to run it as a
	   user, but for first-timers, it's best to just use
	   root to avoid any unexpected circumstances.  

	b. To stop gnudialer, simply type "gnudialer --stop"
	   at a console.  This will stop any running campaigns.

	c. GnuDialer has a safe mode that will cause it to
	   restart itself in the unlikely event of a crash.

	d. The web admin pages allow you to setup and control
	   all of your agents and queues.  Please see the
	   appropriate sections regarding agents and queues.


3. DISPOSITIONS
---------------

	One would think that call dispositions would be an easy
	part of developing or managing a dialer.  As you'll soon
	find out, this is simply not the case.  You should study
	this section very carefully as it is very important for
	planning campaigns and analyzing reports.

	The system of dispositions is meant to be comprehensive
	enough to handle most any situation, yet as easy to
	understand as possible.

	We felt that by limiting the dispositions to a smaller
	set that we could actually provide a more user-friendly
	and customizable setup for most call-centers.

	Basically it works like this... All negative (-) dispo-
	sitions are "system" dispositions, meaning that they
	are the dispositions that are handled automatically by
	the dialplan.  All positive dispositions are "agent"
	dispositions.  The system dispositions correspond directly
	with the agent dispositions.  This means that if you take
	the absolute value of a system disposition, you get the
	corresponding agent disposition.  Please take note of the
	two exceptions to the rule, which are (-1,1) and (-8,8).

	Here's the complete list...

	System dispositions

		-8 == Burned (We give up)      ---o
		-7 == Disconnected Number         | -- Don't get called back
		-6 == Fax Machine              ---o
		-5 == Network Congestion ---o
		-4 == Busy                  |
		-3 == Voicemail             | -- Get called back ---o
		-2 == No Answer             |                       |
		-1 == Undefined*         ---o                       |
		                                                    |
		1 == Not Yet Called** -- Get called back -----------|
		                                                    |
		0 == Callback  ---o                                 |
		2 == No Answer    |                                 |
		3 == Voicemail    | -- Get called back -------------o
		4 == Busy         |
		5 == Fast Busy ---o
		6 == Fax Machine           ---o
		7 == Disconnected Number      |
		8 == Do Not Call              | -- Don't count as contacts
		9 == Invalid Lead             |
		10 == No Sale***           ---o
		11 == No Sale***    ---o These both... 
		12 == Sale          ---o count as contacts

		* Undefined refers to when the dialplan had no match for
		  the HANGUPCAUSE returned by the "Dial" command.  These
		  records should be called back.

		** "Not Yet Called" is neither a system disposition, nor
		   is it an agent disposition.  It fits well as "1" because
		   we don't want to allow an agent to press just "1" as
		   this would cause ambiguity in the dialplan for dispo-
		   sitions 10-12.

		*** Note the existence of duplicate "No Sale" dispositions.
		    This is because some "No Sale" calls should count
		    against "conversion percentage" (which is contacts/sales)
		    and some "No Sale" calls should not.

		If you are not satisfied with your options, you should
		consider using the "subdispo" field via the CRM software.

		The subdispo field is created when you import data. (10 chars) 
		

4. CAMPAIGN SETUP
-----------------

	a. Lead Preparation:

		- Get your leads in csv format.

		- Make sure your phone numbers are in the
		  following format: NXXNXXXXXX

		- Import your leads using the 'IMPORT' button
		  
		  Select campaign, click 'import' (READ THIS PAGE CAREFULLY)
		  The easiest method is to change your data to the ORDER of
		  the default fields, you do something else, there are 
		  sections of code that need to mod'd (and you are on your
		  own)
		
		  OR 	

		  Import your leads via phpMyAdmin (manually setup
		  all data and do NOT use 'IMPORT')

		- Your leads must have a unique "id" field
		  which is an INT.

		- Your leads must have a unique "phone" field
		  which is a VARCHAR(10)

		- From a root console, typp:
		  gnudialer --tzpopulate <table name>
		  This will add all the necessary fields that
		  GnuDialer needs while making calls.

		- puff13+ automatically runs tzpopulate/tzstatepopulate
		  when you import data from dialeradmin.  the data must be
		  on the local system of one importing the data.

		- puff13+ import/export/crm  features are hardcoded in some
		  places, so you must use data that fits the fields (and
		  field order) they are in import.  (otherwise you will 
		  have to modify the code for export crm, etc)
		  the 'Import Data' function defaults to what is required.

	b. Campaign Setup

		- Visit http://yourhost/gnudialer/dialerlogin.html

		- Enter your password

		- Click the "Create Campaign" button.

		- Enter the same name for the campaign that you used
		  when uploading the leads.

		- Done.

5. RUNNING YOUR CAMPAIGNS
-------------------------

	a. Log in to the GnuDialer web admin.

	b. Highlight your campaign from the campaign list.

	c. Click on "Edit Campaign Members."

	d. Add a member to the campaign by highlighting
	   his/her name in "Not in Campaign."  Then click
	   "Add."

	e. Go back to the "Main Menu."

	f. Highlight your campaign from the campaign list.

	g. Click "Manage Campaign."

	h. Click "Start Campaign" from the next page.

6. STOPPING A CAMPAIGN
----------------------

	a. Log in the the GnuDialer web admin.

	b. Select the campaign from the queue list.
	   (If it is currently running, it should have
	    a "*" next to it.)

	c. Click "Manage Campaign."

	d. Click "Stop Campaign."

7. AGENTS
---------

	a. Use the web admin to add your agents.  It is pretty
	   straightforward.  All you have to do is enter an
	   agent name and secret.

	b. Puff is using chan_agent.  So set your agents phone
	   to goto the agentlogin context in dialer.conf
	   Then dial the extension; when prompt to enter agent
	   number, enter agent number followed by #.  Then 
	   enter your agent password followed by #.  If all is
	   well you should hear Agent logged in and some MOH.

	c. Your agent can access the CRM program by visiting:

	   http://hostname/crm/crmlogin.html

	   They should enter their agent number in the login
	   box and click "Go" to login.

	   Please see the crm documentation for more details.

	   If the CRM doesn't say logged in restart your browser
	   and make sure you have no lingering java threads.
	   
	   The CRM tends to not kill the thread if the agent logs
	   in and doesn't take any calls.  So be warned!  

	   Firefox and Internet Explorer have both been tested 
	   and used daily.  (since puff-18-pre release)
